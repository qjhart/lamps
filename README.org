* Lamps

I'm trying to build a template for cylinder lamps.  There are a few we can make,
including those with a flat top, and those with an eliptical rod, not a simple
circle.  For all of these, I'll parameterize them by the angle subtended from
the x-axis (t).  I can create this as a 3-d model with openscad, but I can't
figure out how to unbend the cylinder, so I'm writing the equations and plotting
with gnuplot.

*** Basic (cylinder)

The

#+begin_src gnuplot
  set parameter
  set size ratio -1
  set angles radians
#+end_src

#+begin_src gnuplot
  ang=30*(pi/18)
  sz=30
  a=sz
  b=ang/cos(ang)
#+end_src

#+begin_example
     y
     |
     +--- x
    /
   z
#+end_example

You have taken cylinder parameterized as r*cos(t)i + r*sin(t)j + z = 0

#+begin_src gnuplot
  plot [-pi/2:pi/2] -b*cos(t), a*sin(t),
  [-pi/2:pi/2] -a*tan(ang)*cos(t), a*t,
  [-pi/2:pi/2] a*t, a*pi/2
#+end_src
