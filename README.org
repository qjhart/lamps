* Lamps

I'm trying to build a template for cylinder lamps.  There are a few we can make,
including those with a flat top, and those with an eliptical rod, not a simple
circle.

*** Basic (cylinder)

The [[file:lamp1.scad.png][lamp1]] scad file is an example of in general how I want to construct these
lamps.  The idea is fairly simple.  You have half a cylinder, and then you cut
it off at an angle at both ends.  I'll stitch these components together, and
finish with fiberglass and epoxy.

However, what I can't figure out is how I can un-bend the cylinder in order to
get the proper cutting for the laser cutter.  For the sides, I should be able to
pick the appropriate view direction, if I could then use that to make a 2-d
drawing, but I don't know how to do that either.

**** Gnuplot

The idea here is that I can determine the exact functions of the lines for both
the sides and the cylinder section, and then I can use these to generate a plot
of the data..  Then I can export this as a dxf file, and directly print on the
laser printer.

#+begin_example
     y (j)
     |
     +--- x (i)
    /
   z (k)
#+end_example

I'll parameterize the lines by the angle subtended from the x-axis to the y-axis
(~t~).  So you can describe a cylinder along the z-axis as  parameterized as
~r*cos(t)^i + r*sin(t)^j + z^k~

Now, we rotate the cylinder in the x-z plane an angle of ~R~ (in radians).  The
equation for the cylinder on the x-y plane (z=0) then becomes ~(r/cos(R))*cos(t)^i +
r*sin(t)^j~

This piece is one of the (two) flat pieces that make up the sides of the lamp.
Now, we want to also plot the curved piece on the x-y plane as well.  So, let's
take that same elipse, and rotate it (pi/2-R), so that the original cylinder is
now on along the x-axis, and if we look at the projection of this elipse in the
x-y plane we get the following equation:
